# Pet-Adoption-System

## Solution Description
--------------------------
This solution incorporates the the principles of Semantic Web Technology and XML to create a comprehensive solution for pet adoption. 

The main page consists of three buttons for users to manuever through
different functions of the system.

When user clicks on the first button “I want to adopt!”, it will redirect user to
the page as seen below. Here, details of the pet is displayed. If user is
interested in adopting a pet, they can click the “contact” button where they
would have to enter their name, email and contact number.

For the second button “I want to post adoption ads!”, user will be redirected to
the page to enter details of the pet that they want to put up for adoption. Here,
user would have to enter a password which is important if they want to change
or update the details of the pet. Users can also upload an image of the pet. All
fields must be filled in order to proceed. If there are any empty fields, an error
message will be displayed.

The third button allows users to view, update and delete the adoption ads that
they have put up. When user clicks the button, all the adoption ads are
displayed. There is also a delete button and an update button. To update the
details of the pet, user must first click on the pet they wish to update. After
clicking the update button, they are redirected to a page similar to the page
where they have to enter pet details for the first time. The only difference is
that there is an update button where user has to click after changing the details.
The password page will then appear where user has to enter the same
password they have keyed in during the process of posting the pet. If the
password is wrong, an error message will appear and user cannot update the
details. This is to ensure that only the rescuer who is responsible for the pet
gets to update/delete the information about that specific pet.
